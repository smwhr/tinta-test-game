# test-game
## A game by smwhr

An ink player for some ink games I made.

### Building the game

First, you need to install the [tinta toybox](https://github.com/smwhr/tinta).

Then build the game using `make`.  
Run `make build` to build it and `make run` to run it in the Simulator.


### Multiple games available

- `danger` : the default game, [pdx available to download on itch](https://smwhr.itch.io/1-555-trouble)
- `ecarlate` : in french, to experiment with accent
- `cosi` : in english, computationally heavy
- `hello` : a very simple ink test example

Change the name in `main.lua:10` before running `make`.
